accept_catch_all
----------------
In some cases you do have more than one view with the same HTTP method
per service.
If the client's request has set the accept header to '*/*' pyramid would
choose a view in a quite unpredictable way.
Example: two 'GET' views; one view accepts 'application/json', the other
accepts 'text/csv'.
If the client's request has set the accept header to '*/*' (or none for
that matter), pyramid could choose either one of the two views to handle
the request.

To be able to handle different mime-types we introduced 'accept_catch_all'
view parameter.
One can now specify a view to match 'text/csv' and not '*/*' at the same
time.

The following example uses two services to demonstrate the functionality of the
'accept_catch_all' parameter.

Create a pyramid app which scans the module::

    >>> from webtest import TestApp
    >>> from pyramid import testing
    >>> config = testing.setUp()
    >>> config.include('lovely.pyrest')
    >>> config.scan('lovely.pyrest.itests.accept_catch_all')
    >>> app = TestApp(config.make_wsgi_app())

Perform a get on the first service.
The first service does not take advantage of the 'accept_catch_all' parameter.
Therefore, the result ::

    >>> headers = {'Accept': '*/*'}
    >>> res = app.get('/service/1', headers=headers)
    >>> print res.status
    200 OK

    >>> print res.body
    {"test": "succeeded"}

    >>> app.get('/service/2', headers=headers)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    PredicateMismatch: The resource could not be found.
