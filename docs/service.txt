Creating Services
=================

After you setup your first Project (See :ref:`setup_project`) you can define a
service.
Create a `view.py` file and add it to the package you created:

.. literalinclude:: examples/create_service.py

.. doctest::
    :hide:

    >>> app = get_app('testing.examples.create_service')

With this application you can perform GET requests on the defined endpoint::

    >>> print app.get('/svc')
    Response: 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    {"title": "Hello World!"}

The default renderer of a `Service` is `json`. You can overwrite it in the
method decorator::

    @svc.get(render='string')
    def get(request):
        return 'Hello World!'

Generally you can set every predicate argument which you can use in pyramid.
See `Predicate Arguments
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/viewconfig.html#predicate-arguments>`_.
